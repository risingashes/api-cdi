// There's a handful of endpoints which serve per-guild KDR statistics.
// The kills/deaths only count the final killing blow (not kill credits)
// and only if either (or both) the killer/killee are repping a guild
// at the time of murder.

// GET /v2/wvw/matches/stats/1-1/teams
// Boring endpoints for consistency with other stuff.
