// Provides a paginated list of leaderboard entries for a pvp season.
// The available boards for the season are listed in the /v2/pvp/seasons
// objects under the "leaderboards" field -- and all the configuration
// and stuff is in there too.
//
// All current seasons only have "guild" and "legendary" leaderboards
// which have slightly different outputp formats (since one's for
// individual users and the other is for guild teams).
//
// The region field of the URL cannot be omitted and must be either
// "na" or "eu".
//
// Endpoints can be paginated with ?page_size and ?page query parameters.
// They should additionally emit pagination-related headers.
